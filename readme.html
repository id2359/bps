<em><strong>From the back cover</strong></em>:

<p>For nearly two decades, Kenneth Forbus and Johan de Kleer have accumulated
a substantial body of knowledge about the principles and practice of creating
problem solvers. In some cases they are the inventors of the ideas or techniques
described, and in others, participants in their development. <em>Building
Problem Solvers</em> communicates this knowledge in a focused, cohesive
manner. It is unique among standard artificial intelligence texts in combining
science and engineering, theory and craft to describe the construction
of AI reasoning systems, and it includes code illustrating the ideas.</p>

<p>After working through <em>Building Problem Solvers</em>, readers should
have a deep understanding of pattern directed inference systems, constraint
languages, and truth-maintenance systems. The diligent reader will have
worked through several substantial examples, including systems that perform
symbolic algebra, natural deduction, resolution, qualitative reasoning,
planning, diagnosis, scene analysis, and temporal reasoning.</p>

<p>Along the way, Forbus and de Kleer teach the art of building robust
AI software. They begin with simple examples such as search programs,
and move to more complex cases on the cutting edge of AI techniques,
such as model-based diagnosis systems and a qualitative reasoner. This
software has been tested and used extensively by graduate students and programmers in industry.</p>

<p>Although <em>Building Problem Solvers</em> is designed primarily as a
text for advanced AI classes or AI programming classes, it can be used
by researchers in university and industrial laboratories who want to apply
these techniques to their work, and by programmers who want to incorporate
these ideas in their applications.</p>

Kenneth D. Forbus is Professor of Computer Science and Education at
the Institute for the Learning Sciences, Northwestern University. Johan
de Kleer directs the Systems and Practices Laboratory at the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center.<br /><br />

<em>Building Problem Solvers</em> is included in the Artificial
Intelligence Series, edited by Michael Brady, Daniel Bobrow, and Randall
Davis. A Bradford Book.<br />
