COMPATIBILITY NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The programs in this book were developed on the following platforms:

	Symbolics Common Lisp, on 36XX's and XL1200's
	Lucid Common Lisp on IBM RT's, IBM RS/6000's.

In addition, various subsets of the code have been used on 

	Franz Common Lisp, various platforms
	Lucid Common Lisp, various platforms
	Kyoto Common Lisp, varous platforms
	Symbolics CLOE on 386's
	Macintosh Common Lisp, various Apple computers
	Allegro CL/PC, on 486's.

We have taken great pains to write our code to be as portable as
possible.  However, glitches can occur.  So far, every problem we know
about can be solved by placing the code in its own package, rather
than the user package.  (We recommend this in general anyway, but as
explained in the book, we left everything in the package
:COMMON-LISP-USER for simplicity.)

Here is the list of incompatibilities that we know of, and suggestions
for fixes.  Others will be added as they are discovered.

	MACINTOSH COMMON LISP: We use RLET to bind pattern variables
in rules.  The symbol ccl::rlet is exported into the user package,
which thus causes an error.  You can either tell the lisp to allow the
redefinition of RLET, or use a seperate package.

	ALLEGRO CL/PC: The symbols TRUE and FALSE exported to the user
package from an internal package as constants.  In this particular
port of Allegro Common Lisp, this causes problems even when using TRUE
and FALSE as field names (in the LTMS), even with a non-empty conc
name.  You can either rename the fields or put the LTMS in a package
other than COMMON-LISP-USER.
